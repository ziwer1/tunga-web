                <p>2.4 The Buyer shall provide to the Seller written notice of its finding that the Services conform to the Service Contract within 7 days of the Delivery Date unless it finds that the Services do not conform to the Service Contract.</p>

                <p>2.5 You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with your obligations to other Users. If you do not, you may become liable to that User. You must ensure that you are aware of any domestic laws (including common law), international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations relevant to you as a Buyer or Seller, or in any other uses you make of the Website.</p>

                <p>2.6 If another User breaches any obligation to you, you are solely responsible for enforcing any rights that you may have. For the avoidance of doubt, we have no responsibility for enforcing any rights under a Service Contract.</p>

                <p>2.9 Unless agreed otherwise, the Users acknowledge and agree that the Buyer will hold all Intellectual Property rights of the Services including, but not limited to, copyright and trademark rights.

                <p>2.10 The Seller shall not disclose to any third party the business of the Buyer, details regarding the Services, including, without limitation any information regarding the any software code, the Service Contract, or the Buyer’s business (the “Confidential Information”), make copies of any Confidential Information or any content based on the concepts contained within the Confidential Information for personal use or for distribution unless requested to do so by the Buyer, or use Confidential Information other than solely for the benefit of the Buyer.</p>

                <p>2.11 Depending on the exact terms of the Service Contract, Tunga charges a fee for the use of the platform. Our fees and charges may change over time and can be subject to a special promotion or temporary campaign, or differ depending on specific project circumstances. Upon entering into the Service Contract you agree with our fees and charges as applicable to that particular Service Contract. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts mentioned on our Website are in United States Dollars.</p>

                <p>2.12 Users are themselves responsible for reporting and paying any taxes, including any income, goods and services or value added taxes, which may be applicable depending on the jurisdiction of the services provided.</p>

                <p>2.13 The User agrees that upon request of the Buyer, Tunga generates an invoice for the Services delivered on behalf of the Seller. These invoices can be found in the Tunga Account. Any international and/or domestic and/or local taxes will be excluded from this invoice. Any tax returns and/or tax assessment will be for the sole administrative accuracy, responsibility and risk of the User.</p>

                <p>2.14 To generate the invoice Tunga uses the Project or Task information that relates to the Service Contract, as well as the company data in the Tunga Account of the User. The User is fully responsible for the correctness of the Project or Task information and the company details in the Tunga Account.</p>

                <p>2.15 Although we do our best to generate invoices that comply with all relevant local and international laws and regulations, it is up to Users to assure the correctness of the invoice and to inform us if and when this is not the case.</p>

                <p>2.16 If the Sellers account information is incomplete, he cannot receive a payment. If the Buyers account information is incomplete, he cannot receive an invoice.</p>

                <p>2.17 Users acknowledge and agree that we may in our sole discretion, from time to time, appoint our related bodies corporate or a third party as our agent to accept or make payments (including merchant facilities) from or to Users on our behalf. Such a third party will have the same rights, powers and privileges that we have under this User Agreement and will be entitled to exercise or enforce their rights, powers and privileges as our agent or in their own name. In no event shall we be liable to any User for any loss, damage or liability resulting from the payment administration agent's negligence and/or acts beyond the authority given by Tunga.</p>
